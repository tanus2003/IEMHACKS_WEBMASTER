        <h2>1. Sandy soil </h2>
        <p>These soils are mainly composed of sand (greater than 70%) with very little clay (less than 15%) and/or silt. They generally 
        hold low quantities of organic matter. The soil texture is either a sand or loamy sand. Because these soils contain very 
        little clay or organic matter they tend to be very weakly structured. They are comparatively easy to work. As sand is inert
         with little surface bonding on particles the cation exchange capacity of these soils is very low. Due to the large particle 
         size of sand they contain a large number of macropores which tend to contain air rather than water.</p>

        <h2>2. Clay Soil</h2>
        <p>Clay soils have over 25 percent clay. Also known as heavy soils, these are potentially fertile as they hold nutrients bound 
            to the clay minerals in the soil. But they also hold a high proportion of water due to the capillary attraction of the
            tiny spaces between the numerous clay particles. They drain slowly and take longer to warm up in spring than sandy soils. 
            Clay soils are easily compacted when trodden on while wet and they bake hard in summer, often cracking noticeably. 
            These soils often test the gardener to the limits, but when managed properly with cultivation and plant choice, can be 
            very rewarding to work with.

        <h2>3. Loam soil</h2>
        <p>Loam soil consist of roughly 50% soil solids (a combination of sand, silt, and clay) and 50% pore spaces and water. 
            The size and distribution of pore spaces will depend on the size and shape of the mineral particles, as well as the 
            activity of microorganisms.it has the ability to retain moisture and nutrients; hence, it is more suitable for farming. 
            This soil is also referred to as agricultural soil as it includes an equilibrium of all three types of soil materials, 
            being sandy, clay, and silt, and it also happens to have humus.  Apart from these, it also has higher calcium and pH
            levels because of its inorganic origins.

        <h2>4. Silt Soil</h2>
        <p>Silt is a sediment material with an intermediate size between sand and clay. Carried by water during flood it forms a 
           fertile deposit on valleys floor. The particle size of silt ranges from  0.002 and 0.06 mm. Silt is a non plastic or low 
           plasticity material due to its fineness. It is the smooth and fine quality of the soil that holds water better than sand.
           The silt soil is more fertile compared to types of soil.Due to its fineness, when wet it becomes a smooth mud that you can
           form easily into balls or other shapes in your hand and when silt soil is very wet, it blends seamlessly with water to form
           fine, runny puddles of mud. It is most prone to erosion.

            <h2>5. Peat Soil: </h2>
            <p>Peat soil, known as one of the most problematic soils in the fields of civil and environmental engineering, is formed 
               by the accumulation and decomposition of organic materials (derived from plant remains) under the waterlogged 
               environment where there is lack of oxygen.Peat soil accumulates in wetland ecosystems called peatlands or peat bogs.
               peat soil is a good option for seed starting as it rarely contains harmful microorganisms like weed seeds or bad 
               bacteria.The organic materials in peat soil lock moisture in, making it a useful soil amendment for drier soil types 
               like sandy soil.The most significant downside to peat soil is that it is an unsustainable, non-renewable resource.
