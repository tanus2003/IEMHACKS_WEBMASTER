        <h2>Livestock</h2>
        <p>Livestock are the domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting in order to provide labour and produce diversified
           products for consumption such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, and wool.</p>

         <p>The breeding, maintenance, slaughter and general subjugation of livestock, called animal husbandry, is a part of modern
             agriculture and has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer 
             lifestyles. Animal husbandry practices have varied widely across cultures and time periods. It continues to play a major 
             economic and cultural role in numerous communities.</p>

        <h3>some common types of livestock:</h3>
        <h4>1.Cattle<h4>
        <p>Cattle or oxen (Bos taurus) are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates. They are prominent modern members of the subfamily 
            Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus. Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, 
            see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as riding 
            animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). Another product of cattle 
            is their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have 
            significant religious significance</p>

        <h4>2.Pigs</h4>
        <p>Pig farming or pork farming or hog farming is the raising and breeding of domestic pigs as livestock, and is a branch of 
            animal husbandry. Pigs are farmed principally for food and skins.Due to some biological advantages like prolificacy, 
            faster growth, short generation interval, dressing percentage etc. the pig plays an important role for increasing meat
             production in this region. Black coloured pigs like Hampshire, Large black and crosses are more popular among the 
             farmers.</p>


        <h4>3.Poultry</h4>
        <p>The raising and breeding of domesticated birds for their meat and eggs, such as chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys, and some 
            species of pigeons, is known as poultry. From small to huge scales, anything is possible.A practice known as poultry 
            farming involves raising birds either domestically or commercially for their meat, eggs, and feathers. Important birds 
            including chicken, turkey, geese, and ducks are frequently raised as poultry. Other birds, such as guinea fowl and squabs, 
            are not as frequently raised for food.
        </p>

        <h4>4.Sheep husbandry</h4>
        <p>Sheep farming or sheep husbandry is the raising and breeding of domestic sheep. It is a branch of animal husbandry. Sheep 
            are raised principally for their meat (lamb and mutton), milk (sheep's milk), and fiber (wool). They also yield sheepskin 
            and parchment.Sheep can be raised in a range of temperate climates, including arid zones near the equator and other
             torrid zones. Farmers build fences, housing, shearing sheds, and other facilities on their property, such as for water, 
             feed, transport, and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can graze pastures, sometimes under the control of a
              shepherd or sheep dog.Farmers can select from various breeds suitable for their region and market conditions.
        </p>

        <h4>5.Rabbits (Cuniculture)</h4>
        <p>Cuniculture is the agricultural practice of breeding and raising domestic rabbits as livestock for their meat, fur, or wool.
             Cuniculture is also employed by rabbit fanciers and hobbyists in the development and betterment of rabbit breeds and the 
             exhibition of those efforts. Scientists practice cuniculture in the use and management of rabbits as model organisms in
              research. Cuniculture has been practiced all over the world since at least the 5th century.</p>
