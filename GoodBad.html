        <h2>Good and Bad practices</h2>
        <h3>Good Practices : </h3>
        <h4>1.Crop Rotation</h4>
        <p>Rotating crops seasonally helps break disease cycles, prevent pest buildup, and improve soil health by replenishing 
            nutrients and reducing soil degradation.</p>

        <h4>2.Conservation Tillage</h4>
        <p> Minimizing soil disturbance through reduced or no-till practices preserves soil structure, reduces erosion, and retains
             soil moisture.
        </p>

        <h4>3.Cover Cropping</h4>
        <p>Planting cover crops during off-seasons prevents soil erosion, adds organic matter, and improves soil fertility.
        </p>

        <h4>4.Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h4>
        <p>Employing a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical practices to manage pests while minimizing the use of 
            pesticides.
        </p>

        <h4>5.Precision Agriculture</h4>
        <p>Using technology like GPS, sensors, and data analytics to optimize resource use (water, fertilizers, pesticides) based on 
            specific field conditions.</p>

        <h4>6.Diversified Planting</h4>
        <p>Growing a variety of crops promotes biodiversity, improves pest control, and reduces the risk of crop failures due to 
            environmental factors.</p>

        <h4>7.Agroforestry</h4>
        <p>Integrating trees and shrubs with crops or livestock to enhance biodiversity, improve soil health, and provide additional 
            income sources</p>

        <h4>8.Water Management</h4>
        <p>Efficient irrigation practices, such as drip irrigation and mulching, help conserve water, reduce runoff, and prevent soil
             erosion.
        </p>

        <h4>Soil Health Management</h4>
        <p>Adding organic matter, practicing crop rotation, and avoiding overuse of chemical inputs maintain soil fertility and 
            structure.
        </p>


        <br><h3>Bad Practices : </h3>
        <h4>1.Overuse of Chemical Inputs</h4>
        <p>Excessive use of pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilizers can lead to environmental pollution, soil degradation, 
            and harm to non-target organisms.

        </p>

        <h4>2.Monoculture Farming</h4>
        <p>Planting the same crop repeatedly in the same field can deplete soil nutrients, increase vulnerability to pests and 
            diseases, and reduce biodiversity.</p>

        <h4>3.Deforestation</h4>
        <p>Clearing forests for agriculture results in loss of biodiversity, habitat destruction, and carbon emissions that contribute
             to climate change.
        </p>

        <h4>4.Excessive Irrigation</h4>
        <p> Improper irrigation practices can lead to water wastage, soil salinization, and depletion of groundwater resources.</p>

        <h4>5.Poor Water Management</h4>
        <p> Inefficient water drainage and irrigation practices can lead to waterlogging, erosion, and nutrient runoff, causing soil
             degradation.
        </p>

        <h4>6.Overgrazing</h4>
        <p>Allowing livestock to graze excessively can lead to soil compaction, erosion, and degradation of natural vegetation.
            </p>

        <h4>7.Ignoring Soil Health</h4>
        <p>Ignoring Soil Health: Neglecting soil health through lack of crop rotation, erosion control, and soil conservation 
            practices can result in reduced fertility and degraded soil structure.</p>

        <h4>Improper Waste Disposal</h4>
        <p>Improper disposal of agricultural waste, such as crop residues and animal manure, can lead to water pollution and nutrient 
            imbalances.
